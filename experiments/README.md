# Oblivious DNS experiments 

The sources used for these experiments with ODoH come from these github: https://github.com/cloudflare/odoh-rs ; https://github.com/cloudflare/odoh-client-rs/
These are the odoh-rs and odoh-client-rs codes, which are the only existing codes that allow you to make ODoH requests and obtain results.
Performance comparisons with conventional DNS have been made and the results are given in the files opposite.
